# MindSweep.AI - GTD Clarify Companion

MindSweep.AI is a powerful tool designed to help GTD (Getting Things Done) users clarify their captured thoughts by turning messy brain dumps into organized, actionable GTD elements.

## Purpose

The app focuses solely on the "clarify" step of the GTD process, making it easier, faster, and more emotionally supportive to transform your unstructured thoughts into an organized format that can be integrated with your existing GTD tools.

## Features

- **Brain Dump Input**: A single input space to paste raw thoughts, type bullet points, include reflections, tasks, feelings, or anything on your mind.
- **AI-Powered Clarification**: Processes your input and categorizes everything into GTD-inspired sections:
  - ✅ Next Actions – Immediate, single-step tasks
  - 📁 Projects – Multi-step outcomes with grouped actions
  - 💡 Someday / Maybe – Interesting but non-urgent items
  - 🧠 Reference – Notes, links, info not tied to action
  - 🔍 Open Questions – Thoughtful prompts, things to think through
  - 🪞 Reflections – Emotions, observations, self-talk
- **Review & Export**: Easily export your clarified thoughts to Markdown or copy to clipboard
