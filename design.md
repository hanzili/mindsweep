💡 App Name (Working Title): MindSweep.AI – The Clarify Companion for GTD Users
🎯 Purpose of the App
To help GTD users clarify their captured thoughts by turning messy brain dumps into organized, actionable GTD elements—without interrupting their natural thinking flow.
The app is not a full GTD system; it focuses solely on the clarify step, making it easier, faster, and more emotionally supportive.

🧠 Core Philosophy
Let users think freely and emotionally, not like robots.

Use AI to transform chaos into structured, GTD-compliant output.

Don’t create a new system—help them work with the tools they already use (Notion, Todoist, etc).

🧩 Core Functionalities
1. Brain Dump Input
One single input space (text field or voice).

Users can:

Paste in raw thoughts.

Type bullet points or paragraphs freely.

Include random reflections, tasks, feelings, rants—no need for structure.

2. AI-Powered Clarification
Upon hitting “Clarify” (or similar CTA), the AI processes the input and categorizes everything into:

GTD-Inspired Sections:
✅ Next Actions – Immediate, single-step tasks.

📁 Projects – Multi-step outcomes with grouped actions.

💡 Someday / Maybe – Interesting but non-urgent items.

🧠 Reference – Notes, links, info not tied to action.

🔍 Open Questions – Thoughtful prompts, things to think through.

🪞 Reflections – Emotions, observations, self-talk (kept separate to not pollute task view).

Each section is displayed clearly and can be collapsed or expanded.

3. Manual Review & Edits
User can:

Edit AI’s interpretation (rename/move items between categories).

Mark items as “Done,” “Dismissed,” or “Move to...”

Pin important insights or tasks.

4. Export Options
One-click export to Notion (Markdown block format).

Copy all to clipboard.

(Later: integrations with Todoist, Obsidian, Apple Reminders, etc.)

5. History / Session Log
Store each session locally or in the cloud.

Ability to revisit past clarifications.

Optional tags or session titles.

6. Personalization Settings (Optional for MVP+)
Set preferred task formatting (e.g., [ ] vs -).

Choose tone: “Strictly actionable” vs “Reflective & thoughtful”.

Language (EN / CN dual-language toggle for later release?).
